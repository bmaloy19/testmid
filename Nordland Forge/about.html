              During the recent pandemic, I went to the Bridger Forge shop with
              my friend ,Colton, to learn how to make knives, he let me use his
              shop to make and sell my own creations. And without him my life
              would not be what it is today. Colton decided to make me his
              apprentice, and ever since then I have continued to make progress
              with his teachings. We plan on expanding our businesses and our
              names in this trade.

              At a young age, I fell in love with medieval fantasy. Especially
              with the swords. There was always something about blades that
              attracted me. I loved the artistry behind it. Every blade has a
              symbolic meaning, as if they are sacred. For example in Europe,
              the English swords were designed to resemble the cathedral. With
              my love for blades, and sheer luck. I became lucky enough to find
              this passion.

            Ever since I was 13 I decided to start lifting weights.
            Throughout the years of strict eating, building up my mental
            fortitude and determination. I eventually decided to compete in
            bodybuilding shows. My third show, I met Colton Arias. Luck
            tends to follow hard work. And I was definitely lucky to meet
            Colton. I had just bought my own forge back home a few weeks
            before that show. Got talking backstage with him about
            bladesmithing and telling him that. He mentioned that he was
            going on Forged In Fire in a few weeks. He ended up winning his
            first champion title. We kept in touch throughout that year, we
            both transitioned into college. We got chatting about
            bodybuilding and how I wanted him to join my team Awaken the
            Warrior. He ended up driving three hours to where I was going to
            college at the time. We found out that we have way to much in
            common and became best friends, if not brothers. Later went up
            to my coaches gym and he eventually joined the team. As the
            months went on I took a few trips up to Lincoln to hang out with
            him. He made me a few knives and showed me how.

            Coronavirus hit the U.S. and the world stopped in place. During the
            lockdown I was doing online classes. I knew college wasn’t for me.
            Too many people go without knowing what they want, everyone ends up
            getting a safe job and they waste their lives at it. They never
            really find their passion. That wasn’t my path. I was already taking
            the unconventional route with trying to make it as a pro bodybuilder
            and having my name rise through the fitness industry. Flustered with
            myself and the direction I want my life to go. I decided to leave
            college, move to Lincoln and get a job. I went to the Bridger Forge
            shop with Colton to learn how to make knives, he let me use his shop
            to make and sell my own creations. And without him my life would not
            be what it is today. Colton decided to make me his apprentice, and
            ever since then I have continued to make progress with his
            teachings. We plan on expanding our businesses and our names in this
            trade.
